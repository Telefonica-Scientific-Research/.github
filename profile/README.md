# Telef√≥nica Scientific Research

![Telefonica Scientific Research Logo](./TSR-logo.png)

Telef√≥nica Scientific Research (TSR) is an industrial, multidisciplinary research group founded in 2007. We pursue rigorous, reproducible research that informs real-world telecommunications products and services. Our interests span artificial intelligence (including generative AI, large language models and agentic systems), network optimisation, distributed systems and protocols, privacy-preserving and ethical AI, and early exploration of emerging technologies. We publish openly where possible, contribute to standards, and maintain internal prototypes and production integrations used by Telef√≥nica‚Äôs Operating Businesses.

# Vision
*"Advance fundamental and applied AI research across disciplines, exploring its societal implications and pushing technological boundaries, with a focus on strategic areas to accelerate innovation in Telef√≥nica's key products and services."*

# Pillars of our vision
## Scientific excellence
- Promote the exchange and integration of knowledge across teams and disciplines.
- Act as a conduit for technological innovation and responsible IP generation.
- Foster a high-performance environment that values rigor, reproducibility and continuous improvement.
- Partner with academia to steer research toward impactful, open scientific directions.

## Strategic focus
- Advance fundamental and applied AI research (foundations, applications and societal implications) with an interdisciplinary approach.
- Develop core AI methodologies and technologies that support Telef√≥nica‚Äôs strategic priorities.
- Advance the theory and practice of safe, ethical, and privacy-preserving AI; embed these principles in our work and disseminate them to international research and practitioner communities.

# Mission
- Conduct foundational and applied research addressing both near-term industry needs and long-horizon opportunities.
- Produce open, well-documented code, reproducible artifacts and clear experimental records to accelerate adoption and independent evaluation.
- Translate scientific outcomes into deployable solutions, standards contributions and intellectual property when appropriate.
- Promote safe, ethical, and privacy-preserving AI across Telef√≥nica and the wider community.
- Build sustained collaborations with academia, industry partners and product teams to maximize research impact.

# What you‚Äôll find in this repository
- Open‚Äësource implementations, research code and reproducible notebooks.
- Prototypes, proof of concepts and integration examples.

## A note on impact
Since 2007 our group has grown from a handful of researchers to a compact team that balances curiosity and utility: producing publications, patents and funded projects while ensuring research outcomes can be validated, reused and, when ready, deployed.
